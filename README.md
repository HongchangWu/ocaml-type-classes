# OCaml Type Classes

## Introduction
OCaml doesn't have built-in support for type classes, but it's possible
to emulate them. There is more than one way to do it. The project
shows a way using first-class modules.

## Quick Start
**Prerequisites**: `ocaml`, `omake`

To build the project:
```
$ omake
```
To run the demo:
```
$ ./demo
```
