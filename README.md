# OCaml Type Classes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hongchangwu/ocaml-type-classes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hongchangwu/ocaml-type-classes)

## Introduction

OCaml doesn't have built-in support for type classes, but it's possible
to emulate them. There is more than one way to do it. This project
shows one way using first-class modules.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: `dune`, `higher`

To build the project

```
make
```

To run the demo

```
make rundemo
```
